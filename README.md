# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-SQL-Project
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of pizza sales data designed to demonstrate practical data analysis and problem-solving skills using SQL Server (SSMS).

# Project Objective


# The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to:
Understand overall sales performance
Identify top-selling pizzas and categories
Analyze customer ordering patterns
Generate actionable business insights to improve revenue and operations

# Dataset Description


# The dataset consists of four tables:
  Table           :         	Description
-> orders	        :         Order date and time
-> order_details	:         Quantity of each pizza ordered
-> pizzas	        :          Pizza size and price
-> pizza_types	  :         Pizza name, category, ingredients

# The project covers basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries, including:


-> Data validation and exploration
-> Revenue and order analysis
-> Category-wise and time-based insights

# Skills Demonstrated:


-> SQL Server (SSMS)
-> Joins & Subqueries
-> Aggregate Functions
-> Window Functions
-> Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
-> Business Analytics & Reporting

# Conclusion:

This Pizza Sales Analysis project leverages SQL to explore sales performance, customer ordering behavior, and product-level revenue insights using transactional data. Through comprehensive querying and data validation, the analysis provides a clear understanding of how different pizza types, categories, and time-based factors influence overall business performance.

# Key conclusions drawn from the analysis include:

-> The business processes a large volume of orders, with consistent demand across different days and time periods.

-> Revenue is unevenly distributed, with a small subset of pizza types contributing a disproportionately high share of total sales.

-> Chicken and Classic pizza categories dominate in both total quantity sold and revenue generation, indicating strong customer preference.

-> Peak demand occurs during evening hours (6 PM–9 PM), confirming that dinner time drives the highest sales volume.

-> A significant percentage of orders contain multiple pizzas, reflecting group or family-style purchasing behavior.

-> Some pizza types generate high revenue despite lower quantities sold, suggesting premium pricing or niche popularity.

-> Average pricing varies by category, highlighting differences in perceived value and ingredient cost.

-> Overall, the analysis demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights.

# Key Business Insights:

-> Top-selling pizzas and categories should be considered core revenue drivers.

-> Peak-hour performance highlights opportunities for targeted promotions during evening hours.

-> High-revenue but low-quantity pizzas may represent premium or specialty offerings.

-> Category-level performance reveals customer taste preferences, useful for menu planning.

# Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are suggested:

->> Focus marketing efforts on top-performing pizza categories (Chicken and Classic) to maximize revenue impact.

->> Introduce combo deals or family packs during peak hours (6 PM–9 PM) to capitalize on high multi-pizza order behavior.

->> Promote premium pizzas that generate high revenue but have lower sales volume to increase their visibility and order frequency.

->> Optimize staffing and inventory planning around peak evening hours to improve operational efficiency.

->> Experiment with category-specific discounts or offers during non-peak hours to balance demand throughout the day.

->> Monitor underperforming pizza types and evaluate whether to improve pricing, recipes, or remove them from the menu.
